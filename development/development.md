# Developer guide
OS2rollekatalog consists of several standalone applications, all housed in the same code repository.  
The primary application is the OS2rollekatalog application itself, but there are also three other applications within the same codebase.  
All applications are described in the sub documents, including how to compile and run them as a developer.
