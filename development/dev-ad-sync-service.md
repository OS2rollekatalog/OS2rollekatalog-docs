# ADSyncService application
This application is a .NET 4.6 application and can be opened in Visual Studio 2019. When you compile the application from Visual Studio, it creates a complete application that can be installed as a Windows Service.  
  
To simplify the installation, an InnoSetup script has been created, located in the Installer folder.  
When executed via InnoSetup, it builds an EXE installer with the latest compiled version of the application.  
  
This EXE installer can be run on a Windows Service, where it will install the application and set it up as a Windows Service.
